# Hi, I’m Emmanuel 👋

I am a **Database Administrator** with hands-on experience operating SQL Server and Oracle environments, now extending that foundation into **Azure cloud infrastructure**.  
My focus is on building and operating systems where **databases, networking, compute, and automation intersect**
---

## 🧭 What I Do
- Operate, monitor, and support **on-prem database systems** with a focus on reliability and performance
- Design and deploy **Azure infrastructure** to support database workloads
- Provision and manage database virtual machines and supporting resources
- Apply on-prem DBA discipline to **cloud-based environments**

---

## 🧠 Background
- On-prem **Database Administration** experience covering:
  - SQL Server and Oracle configuration, operations and maintenance
  - Backup, restore, and automation tasks
  - Performance tuning  and Always on High Availability
- Transitioning deliberately into **cloud-based database and platform operations**
- Based in **Nigeria**, targeting global-standard cloud DBA and infrastructure roles
